## Overview
Module 3 consists of 3 weeks and 6 lectures. It plunges into function and class templates. It looks at three Standard Library classes - vector, string, iostream - and shows how to make use of them in object-oriented programming. It reviews class design by using them as examples for operator overloading. It introduces exception handling.

### Input & output (IO) (1)

Today, data dominates computing. The paradigm has shifted from algorithm-centric to data-centric. The most important operations in the new data-driven processing paradigm is input (getting data into objects) and output (getting data out of objects). For us, this means being able to load our points into Point objects and Cluster objects from, say, a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Here is a first glimpse of how to we might do that: If the file holding the point data looks like this:
